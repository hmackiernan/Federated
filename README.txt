setup_replica.sh is the script
that reads
the config file 'setup_replicas'

setup_some.txt etc are pseudo-batch files that run certain of the configs in certain combinations
and in addition reads in some specs (Which are kicking around loose here)


clear_all.txt removes the db and archive files
restart_all

build-root, master_root, edge3_root etc are the actual server roots
